    detail: My work predominantly revolves around adding intelligence to automotive domain. I have helped converting various projects from Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) to long-term projects, mentored and lead teams from technical front.
       Built several POCs using AI which are converted as full-scale projects like Driver Monitoring System (ADAS) on the Edge, Car Parking Solution for Multi-Storey Parking,
       Social-Distancing and Face Mask Detection Solution for COVID-19. 
       Inducing Photo-realism (urban-scene) to Synthetic Data using GANs. Developed a solution for GDPR compliance using Computer Vision & AI.
       Using AI to improve road safety by identifying near-miss incidents at a pedestrian crossing in London (Lambeth). Published in London News.

    detail:  Worked with Dr. Arnav Bhavsar & Dr. Aditya Nigam at the Multimedia Analytics, Networks and Systems (MANAS) Lab on applying Deep Learning to Medical Imaging & Biometrics domain. Part of my first work on generating a detailed 7-Tesla Brain MRI from a low quality 3-Tesla MRI scan is published in ICIP-2018 as an equal first author contribution. Our 7-T MRI reconstruction algorithms outperformed several benchmarks in terms of reconstruction performance and computational efficiency. In my second work, we proposed a novel CNN based multi-decoder framework for reconstructing 7-Tesla brain MRI from 3-Tesla brain MRI along with segmentation results is published in DLMIA-2018 workshop (held with MICCAI-2018) as an equal first author contribution.
