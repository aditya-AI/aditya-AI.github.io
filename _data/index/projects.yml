- name: Detecting Duplicate Images using Deep Learning
  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: aditya-AI
  repo: Detecting-Duplicate-Images-using-Deep-Learning
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/jekyll.png
  desc: In this project I generated real-valued encodings for unlabelled images and compared images to detect duplicate images using L2 norm and KMeans clustering for optimization. I used a convolution auto-encoder.
  
- name: Deep Learning Repository
  i18n: leetcode
  gh_user: aditya-AI
  repo: Deep-Learning
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/leetcode.png
  desc: This project repository explains each and every line of code in detail. All the codes are in tensorflow and uses mnist dataset. It's mostly for beginners who start their journey in Deep Learning.

- name: Detecting True and Deceptive Hotel Reviews
  i18n: familycode
  gh_user: aditya-AI
  repo: Detecting-True-and-Deceptive-Hotel-Reviews
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/familycode.png
  desc: In this project my model had to detect given a review whether it is classified as a true or a deceptive review. I achieved an accuracy of around 86% with naive bayes classifier and 88%-89% accuracy with SVM on the training and test set. The predictions of my model were similar to the predictions made by the tool reviewskeptic.com/ which was developed by Cornell. Finally, I deployed my model using a back end similar to flask in python called Sanic
